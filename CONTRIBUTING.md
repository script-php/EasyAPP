# Contributing to EasyAPP Framework

We love your input! We want to make contributing to EasyAPP as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPL v3 License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPL v3 License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/script-php/EasyAPP/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/script-php/EasyAPP/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Comment your code where necessary
* Follow PSR-12 coding standards where applicable
* Use proper DocBlocks for classes and methods

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your environment
3. Set up a local web server pointing to the project directory
4. Run tests: `php test`

## Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Use the built-in test framework in `system/TestCase.php`
- Place tests in the `tests/` directory

## Documentation

- Update documentation for any new features
- Keep the README.md up to date
- Add examples for new functionality
- Use clear, concise language

## Feature Requests

We love feature requests! Please provide:

- A clear description of the feature
- Why you need it
- How it should work
- Examples of usage

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, inclusive, and professional in all interactions.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the GPL v3 License.
